## Overview

As a **Student Assistant** at **City University of Hong Kong**, I focused on developing educational games aimed at teaching **computational thinking** through the gamification of mathematics and computer science concepts for K-12 students. This work culminated in a paper presented at **CTE2017**.

### Key Contributions
- **Research and Development**: Contributed to the paper titled *"Teaching Computational Thinking by Gamification of K-12 Mathematics and Computer Science Tournament,"* presented at the **CTE2017** conference.
- **Educational Game Design**: Developed *The Algebra Game* and *The Algebra Maze*, applications designed to make learning algebra concepts more engaging for young students.
- **Impact on Education**: Enhanced student engagement in computational and mathematical thinking, fostering a deeper understanding of core concepts.

## Project Highlights

- **The Algebra Game**: A competitive educational game encouraging students to apply algebraic concepts through interactive gameplay.
- **The Algebra Maze**: A puzzle-based game where players navigate mazes by solving algebra problems, reinforcing problem-solving skills in a fun, gamified environment.
