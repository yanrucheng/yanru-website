## Project Overview

The **Semantic Segmentation on Roads** project aimed to improve segmentation accuracy on road scenes by leveraging an encoder-decoder DNN structure. Various architectures, including **GCN (Graph Convolutional Network)**, **PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network)**, and **DUC-HDC (Dense Upsampling Convolution & Hybrid Dilated Convolution)**, were implemented and compared to assess their performance improvements on road scene datasets.

### Objectives
- **Enhanced Segmentation Accuracy**: Apply and evaluate advanced segmentation models for detailed road scene analysis.
- **Architecture Comparison**: Examine the impact of GCN, PSPNet, and DUC-HDC on segmentation accuracy.

## Highlights

Project achievements include:
- A comparative study revealing the strengths of each architecture in terms of segmentation detail, speed, and resource consumption.
- Enhanced accuracy in road lane and vehicle segmentation through DNN optimizations.
- Insights into architecture trade-offs, supporting further research in semantic segmentation.
