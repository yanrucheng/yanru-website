## Project Overview

**PINet (Point Instance Network)** is an end-to-end framework developed for accurate and lightweight lane detection. The network detects key points and clusters them to represent each traffic lane instance, providing a structured approach to lane recognition that is both computationally efficient and highly accurate.

### Objectives
- **Instance Segmentation**: Use key points to differentiate lane instances.
- **Efficiency and Lightweight**: Minimize computational requirements without sacrificing accuracy.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Ensure quick lane detection suitable for autonomous driving applications.

## Highlights

This project achieved:
- Enhanced accuracy in lane detection through a key-point clustering method, facilitating better traffic lane visualization.
- Real-time processing capability, making it adaptable for real-world applications.
- Low computational footprint, ideal for embedded systems in autonomous vehicles.
