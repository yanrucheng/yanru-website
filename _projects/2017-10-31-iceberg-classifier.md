## Project Overview

The **Kaggle Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge** aimed to create a solution that distinguishes between **icebergs** and **ships** in satellite radar images. With significant importance for maritime navigation and environmental monitoring, accurate classification of these objects helps identify potential obstacles and aids in the study of Arctic and Antarctic regions.

### Key Achievements

- **Top 5% Ranking**: Outperformed thousands of entries by developing an effective solution that balanced accuracy and efficiency.
- **Optimized for Deployment**: Achieved a highly compact model under **0.5MB**, ideal for deployment in resource-limited environments.
- **Satellite Imagery Analysis**: Tackled the challenges of interpreting radar images, where distinguishing features are often subtle.

## Visual Insights

The satellite images revealed unique patterns that differentiate icebergs from ships. By focusing on these patterns, our classifier was able to interpret radar signal reflections and effectively categorize the objects.
