## Project Overview

The **Crash Calculator** is a sophisticated tool designed to calculate and analyze crash data metrics efficiently, providing critical insights essential for safety assessments and regulatory compliance. A key aspect of this project is the implementation of the **A* algorithm with advanced heuristic functions**, allowing it to address highly complex pathfinding challenges in crash scenarios.

### Algorithm Complexity

The problem posed by crash data analysis is challenging due to:
- **High Dimensionality and Dynamic Conditions**: Pathfinding must account for dynamic crash scenarios where multiple variables impact the optimal path, and environmental factors can change unexpectedly.
- **Need for Optimal Precision**: The tool must identify the best path with high accuracy, essential for applications that prioritize safety and regulatory compliance.

### Advanced Use of the A* Algorithm

The project leverages the **A* algorithm** with customized heuristic functions to handle these difficulties effectively:
- **Multiple Heuristic Functions**: By adapting A* with various heuristic approaches, the tool can fine-tune its pathfinding based on scenario-specific criteria, enhancing accuracy and responsiveness.
- **Efficiency in Real-Time Processing**: The advanced heuristics reduce computational overhead, enabling quick calculations even in complex crash scenarios.
